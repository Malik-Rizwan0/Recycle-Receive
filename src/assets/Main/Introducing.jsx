                        The best part of the program starts when the items traded in arrive at the accredited recycling facilities. As items enter the circular economy, participants will receive insights through a personalised Sustainability Scorecard. This first-of-its-kind scorecard and level of visibility made possible by Ecoactiv, allows participants to effortlessly track their waste diversion and the conservation of valuable materials.

                        Our aim with the program is to empower customers and the community to embrace recycling with unwavering confidence, knowing that their actions yield a positive environmental impact. Beyond recycling, this commitment extends to your next purchase, where responsible disposal options for pre-loved items are available, further supporting our collective journey towards a greener tomorrow.

                        Together, weâ€™re shaping a world where sustainable choices empower us all.
